# Rough Idea

In this tool, we try to estimate combat capability from ship loss where we can retrieve fit information. We built internal dogma simulator for this, using pyfa data and implementation, there is python cli to create baseline stats from a fit to compare against our dogma implementation and find problems. I have found T3 Cruisers have incorrect values, but others may also be incorrect. I think it would be good if we had cli tool to start fetching zkill fits for this so we can compare real fits. Lets implement this tool, and later use it to fix our dogma implementation.
