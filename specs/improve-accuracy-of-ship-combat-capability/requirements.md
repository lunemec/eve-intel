Q1: What exact outcome should define success for this follow-up effort after the current Ralph task completes (for example, specific parity metrics, error thresholds, or target fit categories)?
A1: Improve overall accuracy of capability metrics across a wide range of ships and fits, getting as close as possible to pyfa real numbers.

Q2: Which specific capability metrics are in scope for this phase (for example DPS, volley, tank/EHP, capacitor stability, application, projection), and are any explicitly out of scope?
A2: Scope is limited to currently surfaced metrics; capacitor and application are out of scope.

Q3: For in-scope surfaced metrics, what acceptable parity threshold should we target versus pyfa (for example exact match where possible, <=1% relative error, or per-metric thresholds)?
