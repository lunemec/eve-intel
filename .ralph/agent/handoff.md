**Original objective:**

```
# Ralph Implementation Prompt: Dogma New-Fit Failing Test Generation

## Objective
Implement the design in `specs/dogma-failing-test-generation/` to add a one-command workflow that turns newly appended zKill fits into scoped Dogma parity failures, with deterministic artifacts and non-zero exit on mismatch.

## Spec Reference
- `specs/dogma-failing-test-generation/requirements.md`
- `specs/dogma-failing-test-generation/research/dogma-fit-test-workflow.md`
- `specs/dogma-failing-test-generation/de...
